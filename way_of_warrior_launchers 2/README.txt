# Launchers for Way of the Warrior (Windows)

## Fast start (recommended)
1) Put these files in the SAME folder as main.py (project root).
2) Double-click:
- install_deps.bat (once)
- run_game.bat (every time)

## Why this works
- .bat does not need PowerShell ExecutionPolicy.
- It always runs from the project folder (so assets/ paths work).
